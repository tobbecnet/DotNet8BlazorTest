# DotNet8BlazorTest

This is a test project for the new dotnet8 blazor features.

So what do we want to test here?

* The different types of render modes
* The new attribute StreamRendering in conjunction with the new render mode types
* Default behaviour (SSR)
* Adding other features to the project, like standard MVC

For demo purposes a small blog post project will be created.
